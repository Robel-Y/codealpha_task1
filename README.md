## 📁 File Structure
image-gallery/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
└── image.ico (optional favicon)

## 🔧 How It Works

- Each image has a `data-category` attribute for filtering.
- Clicking a filter button shows only the images from that category.
- Clicking an image opens a lightbox with navigation arrows.
- Smooth transitions are handled with CSS.
